- place [`wtc`](bin/wtc) under /usr/local/bin directory
- use `chmod u+x wtc` to make it executable

## How to use it

Run `wtc` to fetch a random message suggestion.

Type `y` to approve the message, it will run `git commit -m` with this message, i.e. `git commit -m "I forgot to commit... So here you go."` It doesn't stage files/execute any other git commands.

Type `n` (or just press `Enter`) to generate another commit message (doesn't do anything else, and doesn't run `git commit` until you approve a message). 

`Cmd+C` to quit.
